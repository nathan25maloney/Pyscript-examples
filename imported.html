    <h2 class="main-tagline">This time part of the navbar function was offloaded to a separate utils.py file
    <br>We imported the file with the pyconfig tag and pointed it at our file we wrote
    <br>We can then import that code into our pyscript tag and use it to run the function to add the navbar
    <br>This is where you can also add a statement like packages = ["matplotlib", "pandas"] to get the packages you want to use
    <br>In my experience this is how you could write your page components in JS and import them in to build your webpage</h2>
